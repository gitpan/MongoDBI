0.0.4   2011-12-19

x       add is_id, and is_inc to M::D::Sugar. is_inc will auto-increment the
        field when collapsing occurs (usually on save or insert), and is_id
        adds a constraint that the field must be a MongoDB::OID
        
x       try using boolean::* methods to get exists to work properly

x       more documentation, starting more tests to test chaining and searching
        capabilities
        
0.0.1   2011-12-12

x       properly traverses children of children of child documents (n) levels
        deep

x       added support for gridfs fields

x       collapsing currently only collapses dirty fields but should be mindful
        of fields with default values

x       child and relative document class handlers should pass back the
        document class object reference instead of the handler object ref

x       child and relative document class handlers should be able to handle
        objects as initial parameters

x       this library is soooo new, .... its new
