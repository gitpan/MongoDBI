This file documents the revision history for the Perl library MongoDBI.

-       add the ability to raise/print errors much like DBI.pm's API, and also
        allow this configuration to be specified on the app controller thus
        auto-configuring all associated classes

-       figure out a means to prevent reserved word, database keyword and schema
        attribute naming collisions
        
-       database connection pooling with the ability to read and write to
        different connections
        
-       enable safe_mode by default with the option to turn it off

-       process indexing so that order is preserved

-       add paging convenience method to M::D::S::Criterion

-       add is_id, and is_inc to M::D::Sugar. is_inc will auto-increment the
        field when collapsing occurs (usually on save or insert), and is_id
        adds a constraint that the field must be a MongoDB::OID
        
0.0.3   2011-12-17

x       the chaining keyword, methods, etc have been renamed filter/filtering
        and has a very different syntax
        
x       wrote POD for all classes in need

0.0.2   2011-12-13

x       more documentation, starting more tests to test chaining and searching
        capabilities
        
0.0.1   2011-12-12

x       properly traverses children of children of child documents (n) levels
        deep

x       added support for gridfs fields

x       collapsing currently only collapses dirty fields but should be mindful
        of fields with default values

x       child and relative document class handlers should pass back the
        document class object reference instead of the handler object ref

x       child and relative document class handlers should be able to handle
        objects as initial parameters

x       this library is soooo new, .... its new
